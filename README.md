#### Description: i have made web application that helps parents to commnicate better and easily with their childs so i made two Programs Geolocation "Get your son's location using our web so they can be safe" and chat "You can chat with your son's easily using our wep"
I Built a web-based application using JavaScript, Python, html, css and SQL. I used SQL to make my web application Responsive for that anyone can easily make account and then make
account to his son so i linked between them so they can chat with each other. Then i used python to link all thing with each other like HTML with SQL by Flask which all my program
depends on it. i used mainly flask library in python to write my program. Then i used HTML and css to build my web application templates. Then i used JavaScript to make my web application
more Responsive so i used it mainly get geolocation from user. I wrote all my project on CS50 IDE all Thanks to cs50 staff in my i wrote it in folder called project in which there are
another 2 folders, application.py, data.db and requirements. First application.py whih wrote by python using flask commands i wrote 258 lines which play the big role in this big project.
Using Flask i could link between SQL and HTML and store all data in tables in SQL. Then i used SQL(Structured Query Language) to store all users data in tables in 4 tables(chat, users, sons, location)
so i could pass it into pages in HTML by using Flask. In folder called templates which all components in that folder wrote in HTML being with register.html which you can select
the way you want to complete registeration as Child  or parents then if u selecedt parents you will go to register1.html and if u selecedt child you will go to register2.html. THen
you will re directed to login in login.html. When u completely logged in u will pass in hompage.html. Then u will have two options chat and geolocation. when u pass into chat as parents
u shoul select which one u want to talk with in chat.html. then u will redirect to chat1.html and u can there write and see messages. if u select geolocation u should select who u want
to know exactly where is he in geolocation1.html. then u will redirect to geolocatio2.html. if u logged in as child then u will redirect to geolocation.html to write ur geolocation
which will be shown when u give the permission. That's all .

I want to say Thanks to CS50 staff and D.David malan. i spent a wonderfull time with this course although i found it difficult sometimes in some psets. I love u.
